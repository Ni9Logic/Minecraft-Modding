# Chat Coords
Chat Coords is a Minecraft mod that allows players to easily share their current coordinates with others in the game. With this mod, players no longer have to manually type out their coordinates in the chat. Instead, they can simply press a button to send their coordinates to the chat for all players to see.

## Features
- Sends current coordinates in the game chat
- Indicates the current dimension (Overworld, Nether, End)
- Customizable keybind for sending coordinates

## Installation & Usage
1. Install the Chat Coords mod that is compatible with your preferred mod loader (Only available for Fabric as of right now)
2. In-game, press the keybind (default is N) to send your current coordinates and dimension to the chat.
3. The coordinates will be displayed in the format (x, y, z) and the dimension will be indicated with "Overworld", "Nether", or "End".

## Configuration
The keybind for sending coordinates can be configured in the game's keybind settings.
